# Toucan
Toucan is a custom built portable app for advanced users to synchronise, backup and encrypt their data, wherever they are.

You can find more information at the app's official page at Portableapps.com: http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/toucan

Please note that the application is not being actively developed or maintained. That means that new features
are unlikely to appear and bug submissions will generally not be reviewed unless a pull request with a fix is offered by the community.

Consider the following maintained applications for replacing various Toucan functionalities:
* Sync: https://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/freefilesync-portable
* Encryption: https://portableapps.com/apps/security/veracrypt-portable
* Backup: plain 7z via its CLI or GUI (Toucan uses 7z CLI as a backend)
